Her exposure to art, dance, theater, music and travel is the cornerstone of her design philosophy.
 
After graduating with a bachelor of arts degree in Art History from Southern Methodist University, and living and studying in Milan and Rome, Italy, Shannon moved to New York City to pursue a career as an advertising representative for The Magazine Antiques and Art in America.
 
In 1994, Shannon relocated to the Boston area focusing on family and volunteering. After multiple events planned and helping many a friend with design, she was asked to place her home on a holiday tour in 2002. And, so began the inception of Grace Interiors, named for her daughter. Shannon continues to follow her passion for creating harmony between culture and life style in her work.

Collaborating with my clients brings great satisfaction from to start to finish. Representing their tastes and lifestyles while being cognizant of the balance between FORM and FUNCTION is key. My clients are of all ages and genders with different needs and aesthetic goals. I often help my clients successfully stage their homes to sell and then begin working with them on their new spaces. Detail is important to the process, whether on a huge construction undertaking or when creating a charming vignette. Budget is always a consideration. It is the overall look we are striving for when designing living spaces.

Having full access to the Boston Design Center and countless other decorative resources as well as good relations with architects and contractors, my clients' needs are met on every level.

Whether in a contemporary setting or a very traditional one, I combine balanced lines while adding an eclectic mix with some surprises here and there.

Much of my work has centered on understanding older homes and designing seamless looking additions. This work has lead us to designing “new old” homes with the same charm and detail as their ancestors. I love to integrate the interior spaces with the outdoors as well as pay special attention to the direction of natural light. Of particular interest to me is Landscape Design and the integration of the interior design with planting, patios, decks and outside spaces that unify whole project.

Residential design is special to me because of the close and collaborative nature of the relationship that needs to be fostered with my clients. I consider it a privileged to be asked to work on a home. It is an opportunity to establish the trust required to promote a great design that enhances and broadens the experience of one’s home.

For me, no project is successful unless it has achieved a client’s design expectations as well as their financial planning. As a teenager, I worked on framing crews and later as a carpenter, so I have always maintained a strong connection to the construction process. This has enabled me to practice Architecture with an instinct for financial planning that has served both my clients and their builders as they formulate budgets and build projects.

My commitment to adhering to budgets is as strong as my dedication to great design. It is for this reason that I believe our projects express equally my client’s financial and aesthetic goals.","$200,000 - 1 million",,39 Reviews,Average rating: 5 out of 5 stars,(617) 682-7828,(617) 527-5777,"3D Rendering, Architectural Design, Architectural Drawings, Building Design, Custom Homes, Floor Plans, Green Building, Historic Building Conservation, Sustainable Design, Residential Architecture",Boston%2C+USA,https://st.hzcdn.com/fimgs/17539e64055e41d2_0599-w181-h181-b0-p0--.jpg,https://st.hzcdn.com/simgs/dbd2075205662654_17-1807/home-design.jpg

She recognizes that designing a space is personal and emotional, and her goal is to clarify the process with each client to ensure that the experience of design is as enjoyable as the end result. 

Emily's interiors are bright and fun, yet comfortable, durable, and calming. Her appreciation of history allows her to integrate classic pieces seamlessly into her transitional designs. With a nod to traditional and an awareness of current styles, she creates her own unique interiors that are inviting and visually interesting.  

Emily received her Masters in Interior Architecture and Design from The New England School of Art and Design in 2010. While completing her thesis, she worked for a builder and assisted with the construction of a LEED certified house. She attributes her respect for functional design to her time spent cutting re-bar for the foundation and framing interior walls. She still has her tool belt! Emily went on to work for a high-end boutique design firm in Back Bay where she designed and managed many high profile renovation projects. She launched her own interior design business in 2015.

Member of the American Institute of Architects & NCARB,"At Studio 3.0 we believe that great design begins with a story.  We begin each venture by listening, working with our clients to understand their story and their aspirations.  With this as a starting point, we craft a narrative unique to each project – regardless of scale – which reflects these goals and guides the design process as the project evolves.  The results are bold, expressive contributions to the built environment, driven not by a singular design aesthetic, but rather by a deep understanding each project’s core ambition.

Studio 3.0 is lead by principal Josh Slater.  Josh has been obsessed with design for as long as he can remember:  After outgrowing Legos around the age of 15 he turned his attention to more permanent structures, and won his first national architecture competition while still in high school.  Josh attended Cornell University where he received his Bachelor of Architecture.  He is licensed in Massachusetts, and has significant design experience with both new construction and renovation work, including numerous single family and multi-family residences, as well as commercial, retail, and restaurant projects.","$250,000 - 5 million",50036,1 Review,Average rating: 5 out of 5 stars,(617) 340-2129,(617) 650-2652,"Architectural Design, Architectural Drawings, Bathroom Design, Building Design, Custom Homes, Drafting, Floor Plans, Green Building, Home Additions, Home Extensions, Home Remodeling, House Plans, Kitchen Design, Kitchen Remodeling, New Home Construction, Pool House Design & Construction, Staircase Design, Sustainable Design, Tiny House Construction",Boston%2C+USA,https://st.hzcdn.com/fimgs/c993b9ac0a07540f_0071-w181-h181-b0-p0--.jpg,https://st.hzcdn.com/simgs/9bb2ae4f0a075538_17-1149/home-design.jpg

Ever since I can remember I've loved sewing and taking on creative projects. As an adult, I began designing window treatments for family and friends. And in 1995, with the inspiration to continue doing what I loved, the support of satisfied clients and a solid business plan, I founded KH Window Fashions, Inc.

My philosophy is simple and based on my early success designing for family and friends. I realized the value and key to my success was truly knowing and understanding my client. I knew their style and what they envisioned and I understood how to incorporate my design ideas with their personal and sentimental accents. The result in each case has been beautiful custom designed interiors that complement their lifestyle.

My design talents are proven, and I have worked hard to earn the interior design credentials that allow me to introduce myself to you with industry recognition, professional certifications and industry resources needed to deliver custom design services, brand products and expert craftsmanship. With you in mind, I'll make the custom selections available to me as a professional interior designer and bring you design choices in answer to your style- all from the comfort of your home.

KH Window Fashions, Inc. is founded on the belief that good design starts with good relationships. By your invitation I'll get to know you with the same respect and understanding as given my early clients- and you'll soon be surrounded by the décor that is uniquely you.","$1,000 - 50,000",,18 Reviews,Average rating: 5 out of 5 stars,(508) 393-0572,(508) 393-0572,"Blind Installation, Blinds & Shades Sales, Custom Blinds & Shades, Custom Drapery, Motorized Blinds, Plantation Shutters, Interior Design, Window Treatments",Boston%2C+USA,https://st.hzcdn.com/fimgs/f933bb2c0eab502a_8435-w181-h181-b0-p0--.jpg,https://st.hzcdn.com/simgs/5592dd34041f4947_17-9913/home-design.jpg

Color: “There’s something miraculous when you look at a beautiful object in the natural world—a shell, a flower. Color is truly an individual experience”.

They had seen the results of my own projects... a challenging 600 sq' Back Bay apartment and a four-story row house in Boston's South End were the first back in the '80s. In 1998 my wife and I discovered a 6200 sq.' Greek Revival on a large parcel on Fort Hill. We decided to move to the country. Off to Roxbury.
 
It was here I discovered how much I love focusing on how people use space. I started helping those friends of mine.
 
In 2001 I formalized my interest in renovation into krantzform. Over the years I have assembled a great team of contractors, architects and consultants that I call on when clients don't have their own team in place.

krantzform helps people in the Boston area with their visions. Our major focus is changing space. When you feel change is necessary, we work to balance your needs and wants with the financial reality.
 
Our projects range from a simple modernizing remodel of your home to modest additions or major renovations. The design process is dynamic and should be fun.

We believe interior design is a collaborative process between the clients and designer, as well as the architect, contractor, and tradespeople. Understanding our clients’ unique needs, desires, and opinions is our most important consideration. We combine function, comfort, individual details, and sometimes humor for successful interior design. 

Over the past 25 years, the interior design field has become a vast and complex business. It encompasses many specialty areas including residential, commercial design, as well as restaurant, hospitality, and healthcare, to mention a few. Our resources are equally vast. On a regular basis we visit the Boston Design Center, the D&D building in New York, and the High Point Furniture Market in North Carolina. 

We understand many people have never worked an interior designer before, and are delighted to answer any of your questions about the way we work. If you would like to see more of our work please visit our website and we are happy to schedule a phone consultation or in office meeting.","$35,000 - 1,000,000.,We work on all size projects and work within each client's budget.

---------------------------------

For almost 30 years InnerAsia has been a pioneer and industry leader in producing hand-woven heirloom-quality Tibetan rugs in Innerasia/Khawachen weaving centers in Tibet and Nepal. Founded by Kesang Tashi, a native of Tibet, and recognized authority on Tibetan rugs, InnerAsia has been instrumental in revitalizing Tibet's rug weaving heritage and helping introduce Tibetan rugs to the U.S., Europe and other parts of Asia.

In addition to our standard collection of rugs and runners, that are available in many sizes and colors, InnerAsia also specializes in a full-range of custom design services. Because we design and weave our own rugs, InnerAsia works with our customers and design professionals to create a custom rug with the exact color, size and design elements they need.

In addition to its hand-crafted and custom rugs, InnerAsia recently introduced the Tibetan Hybrid Collection. This  collection of wool and wool and bamboo silk rugs utilizes the latest in machine loom technology to create a collection of Tibetan rugs that preserves in every detail the feel and charm of hand-woven carpets at a more affordable cost.

InnerAsia's rugs are available in a wide range of sizes, colors and designs and can be seen and purchased on our website innerasiarugs.com or by appointment at our Rug Gallery in Thetford, Vermont.","$150 - 10,000,Hand made wool and wool and silk Tibetan rugs from $38 to $75 per square foot.

Our work is divided between working with designers, architects and contractors, or working directly with homeowners.  Whether it's working from your plans or creating a design,  our specialty is adding a critical, experienced eye to the project to make sure your kitchen or family room is the best it can be.

You want to remodel your kitchen, put some cabinets on either side of the fireplace, turn a room into a closet, or add some mudroom cabinets.  What are the advantages of choosing Case by Case Cabinets?

Price:  It is a misconception that custom made cabinets are always the most expensive cabinet option.  If you have been looking at the better quality stock and semi-custom cabinet lines, then your budget can include custom cabinetry.  

Options: There is very little that can't be done with custom cabinets.  There are no 3"" increments or ""standard"" sizes that must be adhered to.  And practically unlimited choices of door styles and finishes.

 Clarity:  Pricing is inclusive--there are no ""extras"" that aren't included in the price, but are naturally part of the kitchen.  A Case by Case Cabinet price includes all required fillers, finished end panels, kicks, and moldings. Cabinets are delivered when promised.

Quality:  Top quality materials like Purebond maple plywood, Blum and Hafele hardware are used to create precision-made, high quality cabinets.  We use the same advanced software and machines as any mega-company.  Who do you think is better positioned to create your dream kitchen?  the company who churns out 30 stock kitchens a day, or the company that works one project at a time?

Experience and Knowledge:  Erik Bittner has been making cabinets since 1986, and has the breadth of knowledge that can only be acquired over that kind of time.  Things do change, however, and Erik keeps up with product innovations, technology, and methods by regular visits with vendors and others in the trade by visiting trade shows, participating in online forums, and attending technical seminars.","$5,000 - 35,000,Job costs vary according to project type and size.  The first step in any project is to come up with a general cost.  I do this by asking you for a general description of your project and size.  For example, if you are looking for a wall unit, I would want to know low long is the wall that you want to put the unit on and how high are the ceilings?  Do you want drawers in the base cabinets, and are the upper units open bookcases?

Power and Associates in the Range/Cooktop/Oven category of their 2010 Home Appliance Study.
-In April of 2010, K+BB awarded the Clarke Culinary Center in South Norwalk and the Asian-inspired kitchen in South Norwalk the Design Award.","Clarke has been a cornerstone of the appliance industry in New England. In 1955, Jim Clarke Sr. opened his own appliance store…The Clarke Electric Company, in Stamford, CT. Four years later, he went to a trade show in Chicago and met Westye Bakke, the founder of Sub-Zero; he soon became their number one independent sales rep.

Fast-forward to 1991, when Tom Clarke (Jim’s son) launched Clarke Distribution Corporation when he was chosen as Sub-Zero’s first wholesale distributor in New England. From just 6 employees and one small showroom, Clarke has grown to be the nation’s most exemplary distributor with two award-winning showrooms (known as the region’s ultimate kitchen resource centers), a Culinary Center teaching cooking to homeowners throughout New England, a nationally known appliance service company and a network of stellar independent retail dealers. Clarke now represents high-performance brands including: Sub-Zero, Wolf, Asko, Best, Dawn, Waterstone, and Scotsman. Tom Clarke has won various kitchen industry honors and the prestigious Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award in New England.

With Tom as Clarke President and CEO, his son, Sean, joined Clarke as general manager of the company and has continued his father’s reputation as an innovator in the industry. Under their leadership, Clarke has reinvented the Clarke Experience for the design trade so that architects, designers and developers no longer just specify appliances, they redefine the luxury residential experience with Clarke’s help and innovation. Sean was distinguished with a New England Real Estate Journal “Industry Leader Spotlight” and named one of DealerScope magazine’s “Top 40 Under 40” business leaders.

The Clarke family’s approach to business has never changed. Their passion for excellence has been unwavering since 1955. As Tom Clarke says, “I think my dad would be very proud of what we’ve done, because we do business the way he did business.”","$15,000 - 30,000",,24 Reviews,Average rating: 5 out of 5 stars,(774) 462-5028,(800) 842-5275,"Appliance Sales, Test Kitchens, Kitchen Design",Boston%2C+USA,https://st.hzcdn.com/fimgs/77f3b04b0d0b7cce_9532-w181-h181-b0-p0--.jpg,https://st.hzcdn.com/simgs/00d26cc604e76b02_17-6752/home-design.jpg

It is an attitude that honors the recent as well as the historical past and one that embraces technology and sophistication while acknowledging the importance and beauty of craftsmanship.

We know that every project and site brings its own particular set of concerns and conditions and that each one is unique to the client and the place. We strive to uncover and enhance these qualities so we can better integrate each house into its site and make the house a true reflection of the client’s aspirations.

AbbeyK a Boston-based interior decorating firm lead by Abbey Koplovitz, who has 18 years in the biz. We are known for our use of color, our down-to-earth nature, enthusiasm, and old-fashioned honesty.

We do every style you could imagine — from classic New England all the way to modern. We delight in working on historic homes and making them comfortable for today’s living.

Why hire AbbeyK?
Clients come to us a variety of reasons. Here are a just a few:

Perhaps you have a small-ish project? These days it's nearly impossible to find a seasoned interior designer to work small, but we love doing consultations as well as defined, concrete jobs: one room,  little bit of this, a little bit of that, pulling it all together.

Are you super busy? Do you lack expertise to decorate or renovate?
We can help you pull it all together. We are organized beyond belief and can simplify the process.

Have you moved, lived where you are for a while, or your life has changed?
We know how to help you think it through. And put it together, beautifully

Maybe you can't find what you are looking for? We design custom furniture, custom offices and custom built-ins -- well custom anything really! 

Perhaps there is something about your home that doesn’t feel quite right?
We are expert problem-solvers and can break it down in order to solve the challenge.

Our clients — It’s about you!
After all, it is your personal space. (That’s why we don’t have a specific look we re-create.) We are interested in helping you figure out how you want your home to look and how you want your home to feel. It is as simple as this: we want you to love where you live!","$50,000 - 1 million,We believe in quality!

We collaborate closely with our clients, together examining project parameters and developing a dialogue to achieve architectural solutions that balance pleasure, work, and functionality. Through focused attention to detail we express how building components create an articulate whole. This approach includes the use of vernacular forms, materials, and tectonics to create contextual, contemporary architecture that engages its site and reveals its best attributes. The careful consideration of how one moves through a space and the resulting sensory engagement with a structure is also a fundamental driver of our design work, as is a commitment to creating forward-looking energy efficient structures. For every project we imagine a narrative that grounds our work with a timeless quality meant to last for generations.

Fine Homebuilding Magazine #256 Dec/Jan 2016 ""Flawless Two-Piece Baseboard""
Featured in Fine Homebuilding Magazine: Houses 2016 ""Against the Grain""","When I was 15 years old, I sold my first job. It was a 10×12 storage shed that sold to my art teacher. I called the lumber yard and gave them a material list to have delivered to my first real job site. My mother dropped me off in her Caravan with all my tools and told me that she would be back around dusk to pick me up. I sat there for four hours waiting for the truck to show up. When it did, I was so excited to sign the slip, despite the gentlemen who did not believe it was for me. For 2-weeks, I built that shed and hand nailed every piece of lumber. At the time, the only power tool I owned was a jig-saw and cordless drill.

I insisted on going to a technical high school. I enrolled at Southeastern Regional Vocation Technical High School and focused in House Carpentry. I quickly excelled in the trade. I was often head of the group, but I respected my peers and we would work as team. Later, I went off to college at Fitchburg State University. There, I received a bachelor’s degree in Construction Management. Throughout school, I always kept my tool belt behind the seat of my truck and my hands ready to work.

When I graduated college, I returned to work for my father and continued doing my own projects on nights and weekends. A month later, I was contacted by a large firm to work in multifamily construction, where I would go off to be a project manager that built high-rises. I remember my first interview and had never been to the city. Since I overestimated my travel time, I showed up over an hour early. I sat down with the gentleman interviewing me and he instantly made a comment about my calloused hands. I was embarrassed and apologized, but he explained that he was tired of seeing kids my age graduate school with no sort of experience. He knew with hands like these that I wasn’t like the others.

With 11 years working for my father, 3 years working in multi-family high-rise construction and 9 years picking up my own projects, I decided it was only right to focus on what made me happy. I left the high rise job behind and started my business, with a focus in residential remodeling, building and custom millwork.

says Julie and Kristin. 

Classic Tile & Stone’s showroom is filled with a great product selection that includes unique and not widely available tiles. The showroom is set up in an art gallery-type style; no massive bin to rifle through, rather it is organized to enhance 
the design and architecture of a room. 

Julie and Kristin are both seasoned professionals with more than 40 years of combined experience. “People know they can trust us in selecting the correct materials for their projects. We are not afraid to let people know if something isn’t working and this honesty lends credibility to our consultations,” says Kristin. Because of this positive reputation in the market, builders send their clients to Classic Tile & Stone with confidence. 

“We walk them through the process-from selections, to drawings, to site visits-yes!  We even make house calls!” says Julie. 

A wide selection of styles and prices allow Kristin and Julie to accommodate every budget. “The biggest misconception is people presume that because we look different and offer unique products, we are more expensive,” says Julie, “but that is not the 
case. We do carry some lines that would be considered higher end but the beauty of tile is it can be mixed and matched allowing for great design at an affordable cost.” 

By managing the process Julie and Kristin assure an enjoyable experience while ensuring that each project they work on has its own unique look.","$1,500 - 100,000,The costs on tile can vary greatly.

Received Best of Houzz 2017 Design Award.","Meghan’s penchant for design began at a very early age. Born on the East Coast, but raised in Texas, the mixture of casual southern charm with East Coast classicism continues to influence her design philosophy. After studying art and design at Providence College and FIT, Meghan worked in London, New York, Boston and Dallas where she gained valuable experience in space planning, color theory, furniture design, lighting, and visual merchandising for industry giants like Burberry, Conde Nast, and Crate & Barrel. 

In 2006, Meghan set out on her own and started Meghan's Inspired Interiors in Dallas, TX with the goal of making interior design more accessible. After a move back to the East Coast Meghan relaunched Meghan Shadrick Interiors in 2010. 

Often seen as intimidating and available only to the very elite, Meghan believes good design should be attainable to varying budgets. She believes in honoring and incorporating cherished furnishings already existing in a home. The combination of bringing together old and new, traditional and modern, high end and low end is what gives a room its soul and individuality. ""Clients often have a good start to a room with some key pieces, but it's the layering in of artwork, accessories, and finer details of a room that many struggle with, and that is where I come in to the rescue"". The result is a space that is fresh, unique, and a true reflection of the client. This is very rewarding for both the homeowner and Meghan. Its a partnership with the client, and a successful design is one that the client truly feels at home in. 

Meghan currently lives with her children, Liam and Cora, and her husband, Dave, in Arlington."," - 25,000-100,000",204203888,14 Reviews,Average rating: 5 out of 5 stars,(339) 674-4642,(339) 368-2900,"Bathroom Design, Color Consulting, Custom Bathroom Vanities, Custom Built-ins, Custom Kitchen Cabinets, Historic Building Conservation, Holiday Decorating, Kids Bedroom Design, Kitchen Design, Kitchen Remodeling, Nursery Design, Playroom Design, Space Planning, Sunroom Design & Construction",Boston%2C+USA,https://st.hzcdn.com/fimgs/29d33d4f0ed246e6_4313-w181-h181-b1-p0--.jpg,https://st.hzcdn.com/simgs/b8b1dfd2046a8432_9-3273/home-design.jpg

She specializes in designing mid-range to high-end spaces that are polished, yet comfortable, colorful, yet serene, and beautiful, yet durable. Now you don't have to wait until you're an empty nester to live in a home you truly love!

Kelly's signature style ranges from traditional to transitional, and incorporates classical design motifs, global influences, fresh color, and unique pattern combinations. She eschews formulaic approaches to create truly original interior spaces with equal parts elegance, simplicity, and practicality.

In addition to understanding the needs of busy families, Kelly also brings a business-like approach (with a healthy dose of humor!) to her work. She previously spent 11 years at advertising and digital marketing agencies in account management, working with Fortune 500 clients in a variety of industries. There, she developed her client-driven philosophy, creative vision, project management expertise, and attention to detail. Although she loved working in a creative business, after the birth of her first son, Kelly knew she did not want to return to agency life. But she wasn't ready to 'retire' just yet, either.

A family member provided unexpected inspiration for a new career. She moved into a beautiful new home, but had delayed furnishing and decorating until her children were older. A new mom herself, Kelly could relate, and was sure that many other families did, too. When she asked Kelly if she ever considered pursuing interior design, the idea for Kelly Rogers Interiors was born.

A certified architectural color consultant, and candidate for a certificate in Residential Interiors at the Boston Architectural College, Kelly is the author of the design blog Interiors for Families. She is an active member of IFDA and NKBA, and her work has been seen in The Boston Globe, Houzz, Wayfair.com, and several blogs and digital publications. Kelly attended Williams College, where she earned her BA in art history and American studies.

Kelly lives in Newton, Massachusetts with her husband, two sons, and their mischevious and adorable lemon beagle.",,,12 Reviews,Average rating: 5 out of 5 stars,(617) 874-1938,(617) 233-3725,"Bathroom Design, Closet Design, Color Consulting, Custom Blinds & Shades, Custom Furniture, Custom Rugs, Floor Plans, Kids Bedroom Design, Kitchen Design, Nursery Design, Playroom Design, Space Planning, Universal Design, Kitchen Remodeling",Boston%2C+USA,https://st.hzcdn.com/fimgs/4783de47036064dd_7248-w181-h181-b0-p0--.jpg,https://st.hzcdn.com/simgs/c5e26d9d041f7ee9_17-0483/home-design.jpg

Jill Litner Kaplan has been involved in the world of design for the last 30 years. She has a natural passion for fashion, loves fine fabrics and knows how to create an assortment that is visually stimulating and dynamic with no detail spared. Jill truly understands how to create an environment that is a unique expression of her clients: one that addresses their style and preferences, while at the same time, infusing it with her own well honed taste and sense of energy. Having travelled extensively and lived in Paris, Jill carries her worldly sense of style and love of collecting art and objects throughout all of her projects. Jill has developed an outstanding dedicated team that provides comprehensive design services to her clients, is very resourceful, highly organized and committed to providing hands-on management to each of her projects.

Raised in Boston, Jill moved to New York City to attend Columbia University and went on to live, work and play there for the next 12 years. Trained by Saks 5th Avenue and Macy’s as a women’s designer sportswear buyer, she honed her skills in the luxury goods business, merchandising and marketing for stores across the country. She subsequently worked for Burlington Industries as a product marketing manager in their home furnishings division, where she learned how to manufacture fabrics and consumer products. Each of these experiences provided her with an opportunity to train her eye, be creative, manage and operate very detail-oriented businesses in both the apparel and home furnishings markets. 

Driven to refine her management skills even further, Jill moved back to Boston to attend Harvard Business School, and upon graduation, started her own retail consulting firm called JK Creative Retail Solutions, LLC in the Back Bay.

The engineering department at Walpole is the most advanced in the fence industry. Every order is reviewed by these professionals for manufacturing accuracy. In more technical custom work, engineers use high-tech CAD systems to produce detailed drawings. Customers then have an exact representation of how their project will look when installed.

It was formed with the foundation that effective interior design is building and nurturing an interior that our client’s truly love and we are proud of creating.  Besides Ryan’s background in interior design, he also has worked for Boston’s best lighting showrooms. He is a skilled lighting specialist, having this unique marriage of lighting and interior design, sets us apart. Great lighting design gives a space warmth and character. With this philosophy, we have been successful and now celebrating our seventh year in business. 

Our design style is contemporary and transitional in the respect we design for now, not what interiors have been. We use a great basis of classic design elements that are used in a different way or a new function. Contemporary design is historic, bold, vintage, funky, classic, and minimal yet sophisticated. This mix of eclectic materials makes each space different and is bursting with character. We love hunting and picking for those unique items in unconventional locations and creating custom pieces that are one of kind.

The second part of our business is service. We know that it’s not easy to piece a project together. It is equal parts vision, organization, and completion. But this process can be fun! We work with our clients to provide honesty, transparency, and communication from concept to placing the final accessory.

Lead Certified Renovator with the EPA","I’ve been involved in the painting trade ever since I was a young kid. I spent my time as a teen, learning the trade from the inside out by starting at the bottom and working my way to running jobs as a foreman. Upon graduating from Umass-Lowell with a business management degree, I decided whole heartedly to create Big Dog Painting and I’ve never looked back. 

For me, there is something incredibly gratifying when we walk into a project that is extremely worn or tired looking and when our work is done it's magazine worthy. The tangible transformation process is what truly keeps me and everyone involved motivated to consistently deliver a fantastic product. 

I have yet to meet a client with a higher expectation than my own. I’ve built my company on referrals, and I take an incredible amount of pride in everything we do. 

My business philosophy is really pretty simple: I try to surround myself with good people and deliver a fantastic product. I figure if I can manage that, the rest will fall into place. 

I appreciate your consideration,

We connect with our clients personally and consider each family’s story, style, functionality needs, and budget.  We source the materials, put together tangible design boards, and oversee the projects from start to finish. We create sanctuaries unique to each individual that aim to inspire and improve well-being. We work with trusted vendors and contractors to remodel homes. 

We specialize in custom window treatments, and we are a Hunter Douglas showcase dealer. We build custom furniture, cushions, and pillows made with the finest materials. We reupholster furniture and we sell hand woven rugs and fine art in our design showroom. 

As a husband and wife design team we are unique, providing two different perspectives on each project. TJ brings an artistic and creative viewpoint to each project. He thinks outside the box and comes up with options specific to a client’s needs. TJ can fix or create anything. He can see how an idea will work spatially and he helps clients to improve the efficiency of their homes. TJ is the window treatment expert. He offers our clients solutions and advice on everything from shades, shutters, drapes, and motorization to reupholstery and window film. TJ has extensive knowledge and resources in home renovations. But, more than anything else, TJ is passionate about creating and wood working and he can get lost for hours building a custom furniture piece for a client.

With a background primarily in psychology, Rebecca offers much more than beautiful designs. She connects with the clients, helps them to visualize and find their aesthetic style, and creates a space that reflects them personally. She believes a home should be a sanctuary and a space to motivate and improve well-being. Rebecca helps clients to hone in on what is most important and to let go of clutter. She changes the function of spaces when needed, simplifies, brings in the colors, styles, cherished memories, and creates calming, elegant spaces unique to each individual and family. We create atmosphere in each of our designs.

We believe each space should improve functionality, beauty, and comfort. Our goal is to decrease stress and save our clients time and money. We enjoy getting to know people and creating designs that are perfectly suited for their individual style, work, family, and lives.

Mobi gets its roots from Detail Woodworking, where the custom cabinetry business has been booming for over 25 years. With this firm foundation established, the team decided it was time for reinvention: to simplify, modernize, and evolve with a more holistic approach. We take every component of a space into account when creating your cabinets, designing in a way that transforms your kitchen into a living area — a place where functionality, comfort, and entertainment come together flawlessly. 

DESIGNED TO DEFINE OUR TIME. BUILT TO OUTLAST IT.

Everything is made on site by our dedicated team, utilizing top of the line technology and proudly made in the USA.  We wanted to create something brand new in the industry, something that could change the way we see cabinetry. The vision was modern and elegant, featuring simplicity and organization down to every last detail. What made Mobi so special was this idea to streamline the entire cabinet making process, from the client’s choices through the cabinet production. We have simplified a rather complicated experience to make it easier for our clients to get exactly what they want in a systematic manner. The idea included creating an extremely high quality product that exemplified our dedication to design and trend, one that was modern yet customizable — and thus, Mobi was born: Modern, Out of the Box Ideas, a standout in the custom cabinetry world.

During its 28-year history, MSH Architecture Associates has been creating projects that are responsive to their surroundings.  MSH Architecture’s projects exhibit a unique formulation of light-filled open and interlocking interior spaces, as well as a clear respect for the nature and structures that surround them. The designs exhibit an efficient use of space, maximizing potential views and integrate well with the outdoors. 

Marc Hershman, founder and principal of MSH Architecture, believes that designers are often preoccupied with the exterior appearance of their buildings, only to neglect the inside space, or create interior layouts that are interesting but package them in structures that completely ignore their settings.  MSH Architecture Associates works to address both the need of the Owner to create effective functional spaces, whether the project is a home or a business, and the desire of the Owner and the community to have the project fit into its setting.

In addition to concentrating on residential projects, the firm specializes in condominium conversions.

For us, green means a focus on common sense sustainable design and construction practices, natural materials that weather and wear well as they age, designing and building spaces to last, and integrating built structures with the site and landscape.  We make an effort to stay on the cutting edge of new technologies, materials, and building practices to create more beautiful, functional, energy efficient and healthier homes.

In a world where people are becoming more isolated in their own neighborhoods, we are on a mission to bring people together in human, personal connections. We want you to know the people in your neighborhood that have the talents you need. Our certified builders are local craftsmen that you may or may not find on the internet.

We believe that this world is filled with an abundance of talents. Finding those right next door who have the skills we need, is becoming increasingly difficult. Larger companies dominate the internet and are easy to find. You may not even know your next door neighbor is a skilled craftsman who has owned a small, multigenerational, family business for many years. Many of these small businesses operate by word of mouth and if you aren’t in the loop then you aren’t in the loop.

A small local business is committed to your satisfaction because they need you as much as you need them. Large corporations are often more committed to profit than to the consumer. A small local business is committed to relationships and their reputation in the neighborhood because they know these things are important for their survival.

Small local businesses are often exceptional craftsmen. Many small businesses have been pasted down for generations and the skill, efficiency and problem solving abilities surpass that of larger factories who employing minimum wage workers for a short time with lots of turn over.

We believe onsite shed construction has many advantages. You get a brand new shed built right in place without heavy equipment going across your yard. When your shed is built onsite it is brand new vs. the large factory model which buys and stores materials months in advance. Fully assembled shed may sit at the factory for days or weeks before being shipped. After being shipped 3 or 4 on a Semi trailer to your region, the shed may sit at a sales lot for weeks or months till it is finally sold for your backyard. A shed built onsite is brand new when you give the final payment.
