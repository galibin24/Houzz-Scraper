We work with you to make sure that your space is both beautiful and practical and make the design process an enjoyable one!

Katie’s unique way of approaching design stems from her time working in prestigious high-end residential studios such as 1508London and Fenton Whelan, where she acquired both the design and client presentation methods.  Every design process starts with an in-depth brief where Katie assesses your needs and desires. This is then translated into a concept design, supported by revised layouts, proposed fabrics, materials and sketches until we hit on the perfect design for your home. Following this, we install the design into your house, project coordinating the whole design and build from structural changes to the very last accessory.
