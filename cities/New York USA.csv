Featured Designer on Apartment Therapy, HGTV, & Elle Decor.
From construction consults to decorating homes and gut renovations, we work to make our clients' homes both welcoming and beautiful.

Jarret has clients throughout the country, and focuses primarily in New York, Hawaii and Miami.

Every home offers an opportunity to create harmony and beauty. Jarret's goal is to create a personalized living experience that resonates with and enhances how you live.

The foundation to designing a livable solution is by understanding what is most important to you. What isn’t working for you? What do you wish for? What would make you happy?

From that point, we then take an inventory of your own personal collection: what has meaning and resonance?

Then we can begin to build around those items. From one-of-a-kind vintage or exotic overseas pieces to familiar American or items from antiquity, Jarret incorporates both classic and modern objects to balance, weave and construct your space.

Jarret delivers to you a comfortable, customized home that will remain timeless, personal and appealing — a source of enduring beauty, tranquility and happiness.

Jarret Yoshida Design promises to evoke a feeling of accessible indulgence, luxury and well-being — for real, everyday living. Jarret’s vision combines sophisticated elegance and relaxed ease, a classic approach that is personalized for each client.

Jarret is an interior designer who has traveled the world to develop his distinct style. Studying internationally and at design schools, his work developed a formal cosmopolitan poise, while he remains deeply inspired by the quiet harmony of Japanese æsthetics and the warmth and welcome of his Hawaiian childhood home. His designs reflect this unusual combination of experiences.",Jarret Yoshida Design,http://Jarretyoshida.com,https://www.houzz.com/professionals/interior-designers-and-decorators/jarret-yoshida-design-pfvwus-pf~126290560,"$25,000 - 500,000",,67 Reviews,Average rating: 5 out of 5 stars,(718) 636-5321,(718) 636-5321,https://st.hzcdn.com/fimgs/0193c67902a2092f_2967-w181-h181-b0-p0--.jpg,"3D Rendering, Art Selection, Bathroom Design, Closet Design, Color Consulting, Custom Bathroom Vanities, Custom Blinds & Shades, Custom Bookcases, Custom Built-ins, Custom Cabinets, Custom Entertainment Centers, Custom Fireplace Mantels, Custom Furniture, Custom Home Bars, Custom Kitchen Cabinets, Custom Pantries, Custom Rugs, Custom Shelving, Custom Storage, Custom Table, Custom Walk-in Closets, Decluttering, Dining Room Design, Downsizing, Drafting, Energy-Efficient Homes, Floor Plans, Furniture Selection, Green Building, Guesthouse Design & Construction, Historic Building Conservation, Holiday Decorating, Home Office Design, Home Staging, House Plans, Interior Design, Kids Bedroom Design, Kitchen Design, Lighting Design, Living Room Design, Nursery Design, Playroom Design, Project Management, Space Planning, Sunroom Design & Construction, Sustainable Design, Universal Design, Wine Cellar Design, Kitchen Remodeling, Construction Administration"

The quality of our work led to referrals and through word-of-mouth, our businesses has thrived for more than 50 years. John Wolf, Jr. began working alongside his father as a young boy, and after graduating from college, returned to help run the business. Most of our staff of 20 have been with us for decades, and our family of craftsmen work together to insure quality and timliness.

Over the years, our shop has expanded to encompass over 12,000 square feet. We still complete every job in-house, using a combination of the most modern automated saws, lithes and sanders with old-fashioned hand-carving and refinement.

We custom build each piece to complement your personal lifestyle, using the finest woods with molding colulmns, capitals, pliasters or any combination. Contact us to find schedule your appointment today.At Little Wolf, we put over seven generations of woodworking expertise to work for you!

We meet personally with each client in our Manhattan workshop to consult on your project. We'll review floorplans, show you the possibilities and discuss your needs to come up with a custom quote. After we agree on an estimate, we'll take measurements in your home and create the final drawings. Your tailor-made cabinetry or casework will be completed in an average of just six weeks, thanks to our trusted staff and in-house operations, at which time we'll call you to make an appointment for installation.

Plainspace Architecture + Design was founded in 2001 in New York City by Angelica M. Ruano. The original premise was to provide Architectural, Interior and Design services with a high level of direct personal involvement and collaboration for and with each client. Every project is undertaken as an individual pursuit toward a simple and clear design solution appropriate for the particular client, scope and context. No two projects are the same. Our work is an exploration of the interplay between Architecture and materials and the continuing tradition of simplicity and practicality in design both visually and philosophically.

To us a project encompasses much more than a meaningful design. It is a complex process involving many challenges and decisions which we carefully define and navigate our clients through. Over the years we have expanded the scope offering to include Project Management and Owner representation services to provide services which offer more control and clarity throughout the project process.

Plainspace Architecture and Design was joined by Marc Albertin in January of 2007.

Our unique process ensures that we finish projects on-time, on-budget and to our clients’ satisfaction. Our goal is to help you define and transform your space into that ""dream space"" within a realistic budget. Constant communication, from the start of the project to the last finishing touches, keep you in control of the entire design and renovation process.

At the initial consultation we gain insight into the nature and scope of the project by discussing factors such as design motifs, themes, materials to be used, timeline and the general budgetary parameters. During this phase all selected components come together with floor plans, wall elevations and a 3-dimensional image to assist the client in visualizing the actual space. Revisions are prepared if necessary. Full-color artist renderings and product samples are available if necessary. Finishing elements such as door styles, hardware, counter top materials, appliances, plumbing fixtures, stone vs. tile layouts, and glass enclosures are all incorporated into the design. A modest retainer is required at this stage. Once the project is accepted and approved, a contract that includes the pricing, detailed project description and finalized design plans is prepared and signed. The product delivery is scheduled and we coordinate with our in-house design consultants, project managers and licensed installers to execute the renovation and installation. 

At Berceli, we are committed to getting the job done right. Upon completion of each project we take the time necessary to ensure complete customer satisfaction and will make any finishing touches necessary. At Berceli, we guarantee our integrity, attention to detail, and the ability to meet and exceed our clients’ expectations.

We are a vertically integrated manufacturer that controls every step of the turf manufacturing process, and all SYNLawn® products are made in the USA.

Synthetic grass has come a long way, and SYNLawn® has been a top innovator in the industry. Synthetic turf has always benefited the environment because caring for it doesn’t require constant use of water and chemicals the way real grass does. But SYNLawn® has made artificial turf even better by using recyclable materials, reusing our manufacturing waste and replacing petroleum with renewable, biobased soybean oil.

For both quality and variety, SYNLawn®’s product line stands above what any other artificial turf manufacturer can offer. We make synthetic grasses for every kind of residential or commercial purpose, from artificial lawns to safe, resilient playground turf. SYNLawn®’s athletic turf stands up to hard use either indoors or outdoors, and like all of our products it’s very low maintenance and keeps looking good in any weather.

SYNLawn® has the artificial grass you’ve been looking for, no matter where you need it:

    Residential lawns
    Patios, decks and rooftops
    Commercial landscaping projects
    Backyard putting greens
    Country clubs or golf practice facilities
    Playgrounds and recreation areas

Peter blends both classical and modern traditions to foster complete environments to improve one’s quality of life.

Peter’s love of architecture and design began in childhood when he visited buildings designed by his great grandfather, Pietro Lombardi.  He was inspired to study Architecture both in the United States and abroad. After receiving his Master of Architecture degree from Syracuse University, Peter worked in Florence, Italy for three years exploring the diverse approach to architecture and design unique to Italy and Europe at large.

These experiences led him back to the United States and a position with Robert AM Stern Architects. Here he was able to merge his European experiences with the best of American design. Peter's collaborative role with Robert Stern culminated in projects such as: the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum in Texas, Villa Fleuri in France, a private residence in Highland Park Illinois, and numerous private residences in New York City.

In 2010, Peter created his own firm, Peter A. Lombardi Architects, leading high end residential and commercial projects in the United States and internationally. Peter is now merging his architectural forte with the larger realities of permaculture, organic farming, water collection and clean energy through is invention called ICOT®.

Our approach to every project is specific to the client, site, space, and budget.

We are a full service design and architectural studio. We believe that in order to achieve a well designed, thoughtful project, an architect should be involved in all aspects of design, starting with project objectives, planning and space layout, selection of finish materials, built-in cabinets, custom furniture and lighting design. We begin with a ""clean-slate” that leads to intense study, a process of discovery, and a creative approach to space, design and details.

From start to finish, we believe that good design is only half of the process. Selecting the right contractor and having the architect’s presence on site during construction (normally once a week) is a key part of a successful project. In addition, we provide immediate follow up with our clients both during and post-construction, providing a comprehensive service that leads to a successful outcome and an excellent relationship with our clients.
