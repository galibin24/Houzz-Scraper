We understand regulations and possess good historical knowledge, which allows us to question often-limiting planning policies and achieve results that defy the rule-book.

EHG HOME is offering a full furniture rental and interior styling service to help the marketing of properties to allow potential buyers to visualise how they would live and function within a space. Our aim is to highlight the positive aspects of a property by adding warmth and ambiance through staging. 

We also offer pre-sale consultations on how best to present your property to the market. Properties can be cluttered and furniture not aligned to the proportions of a room so we advise on how best to maximise the appeal. We aim to create a lifestyle that will appeal to your specific target market. Unexpected details really make a property stand out, in the same way a stylishly dressed person stands out from the crowd!

We offer the flexibility to partly furnish or fully furnish, working with our clients to achieve whatever end result is required. This modest investment in dressing a property can result in better prices and faster sales.

We are focused on bringing US furniture over to the UK to offer something different and unique to the staging market whilst still being affordable. Using quality furniture makes properties look more valuable.

If you are living in your property while it is on the market, our expert stylists can reposition/swap in furniture, declutter and depersonalise. We can look after your possessions whilst your home is on the market, removing personal possessions is important so that potential buyers can imagine themselves living in your place; not how you live in it!

I founded Honey Bee Interiors with the aim of making interior design accessible and affordable for everyone. As an experienced interior designer and stylist, I enjoy working on smaller projects including e-decoration as well as more involved design projects where I help to design, decorate, source and refurbish residential and commercial properties. I am also happy to provide advice and interior design schemes on a room by room basis. 

My style is bold, fun and colourful, mixing vintage influences with contemporary style. Most of all, I think it’s important for spaces to have real character and to reflect your individuality. My past projects have been featured in Beautiful Homes, Ideal Homes and Living Etc.

My clients often comment that I’ve created a home that feels exactly in keeping with their style - but just a little bit braver than they would have dared to choose on their own! From our initial consultation, I’ll gather a good understanding of what you’d like to achieve with your space. We’ll work closely together, as I always present you with different options for each aspect of the design. This means you’ll be left with a space that you both love and feel connected to. 

I also own The Vintage Chandelier Company, where I discover and sell antique and vintage chandeliers that have been lovingly restored to make unique one off pieces for contemporary homes.

From the first sketch to the final decoration we help our clients developing and realizing bespoke living spaces, from (private) residences to hotels.

Our strength is conceptual thinking. We believe a design should not be dictated by how it will be perceived, but should anticipate how the designed space will be used and experienced. This requires a thorough assessment of the wishes and needs of the client or the end-user.

Our distinction is embracing heritage. We believe in enduring stylishness, rather than the whim of the moment. This requires an extensive investigation into the project or place itself. Its origins, its history, its characteristics.

We aspire for a concept that logically links these elements together. Connecting people to spaces. Aesthetics and practicality, history and future, should blend perfectly together.

Fortunata originated seven years ago from a desire to share our passion and aesthetic knowledge with others. Our clients allow us to work independently, with freedom of artistic expression and creation, trusting that this will provide them with the optimal design. When a concept comes to life, to see our designs being turned into real spaces, is pure magic. We feel very privileged to be given an opportunity to hand over our views to the people who will be living or working there.

House of Fortunata

Our story
In 1780 the energetic Italian dressage rider Maria Antonia Fortunata met an Amsterdam aristocrat and merchant, 
using elegance and vivacity with class and reason.
230 years on, our family still holds to those pillars, adding a touch of the past to it.
We believe that behind every great design lies a meticulously developed concept. 
Sprezzatura, as the Italians so wonderfully call it.
Our concepts are built up from practical purpose, historic understanding and the timeless laws of proportion and style. 
A purpose for every detail. Aesthetics out of logic.
Thus Fortunata today creates the heritage of tomorrow.

Our company

Over the course of more than 25 years working in photography, I’ve built up a reputation for specialising in beautiful interior design and product photography which is visually arresting. 

Working with designers, suppliers, developers and brands, I deliver photography that communicates a desired message and generates interest. I am focused on bringing value to your business and delivering consistently outstanding results. 

I work with many of my clients on an ongoing basis, building a deep understanding of what they are trying to achieve in their branding or marketing. My success is totally aligned to the success of my clients: they have had key products sell out or won prestigious interiors awards on the back of our photo shoot. This is what I’m here to help you achieve. For this reason, I don’t consider myself a passive participant of the photoshoot, and will contribute ideas and suggestions where appropriate. 

Find out what my past clients have to say about the value I’ve delivered for their businesses: 

""Graham Atkins-Hughes is, without doubt, the most talented interior photographer and filmmaker I have worked with here in my current role and as Creative Director at French Connection Home."" 
- Lorraine Brennan, Creative Director at French Connection Home

""Graham is a fantastically professional and creative interior photographer. Over a period of four years working with him on a number of large and complex interiors shoots, he has proven his worth time and time again.""
- Beth Hendry, Senior Account Manager at Springetts Brand Design

""Graham was one of the key interior and lifestyle photographers that I used both at Selfridges and Marks and Spencer. I shot with him in the UK and on extended location trips overseas – he even coped with shooting at -35ºc in the Arctic Circle. He is a brilliant photographer, ahead of the trend and always pushing boundaries.""
- Nikki Garnett, Digital Influencer

""He has the right balance between moving a shoot forward whilst also listening to the client’s requirements. Thanks to Graham’s focus, we have consistently managed to achieve a surprisingly high number of shots per day, which has a very positive impact on the budget.""
- Jo Israelsohn, Managing Director at Portrait Communications

Having previously worked for 7 years in both Paris and London for Italian architect Renzo Piano on the design of the Shard of Glass, as part of a permanent site team of two, leading the delivery of the top 20 floors, I made a decision that that building was as large as I wished to go. I wanted to get back to working directly with builders and homeowners, concentrating on a few projects a year which I would dedicate myself to. 

Since founding Giles Reid Architects in 2016, I've worked on an apartment on the Thames. I have a large restoration of an Edwardian house on site in Muswell Hill and am out to tender with a timber framed side extension.

My ambition is to combine contrasting strands of Architecture and craft spaces which I hope have a quiet beauty to them. I believe that good architecture is fundamentally about construction, a sense of history and sensitivity to proportion. I hope some of these qualities can be seen in the work emerging under my name.

I enjoy having the chance to work closely with people who know their craft. On the Shard that included world experts in tall building structures, steel and glass. However, on smaller projects, I've learnt as much if not more from a plasterer with 30 years experience. I think the key is to balance knowing what you want, not giving up on that, but also being open to what you can learn from the best people and precedents that are around you. Successful jobs all have three things in common - a good design, a committed client and a passionate builder. You can't achieve anything lasting without all three coming together and everyone working towards the same common aim.

We derive some of our inspiration from the restrictions of a brief and the notion of problem solving. It is the precise aesthetics of the chosen solution that determines whether the resulting architecture is a success. That part is more subjective and difficult to describe, so we hope the images will speak for themselves. 

We tend to eschew surface applied decoration, preferring to create interest and texture in form, light and the natural beauty of materials in their elemental state. Beyond this we do not wish to promote a practice style, as we believe it is the unique characteristics of each individual commission, rather than a pre determined stylistic approach, that is the most important generator of lasting and innovative design.

Ultimately, architecture is not about drawings, models, computer simulations or websites, however seductive we may strive to make them. Nor can it be truly found in theories and the spoken or written word. Architecture is above all a practical art and is a physical thing you can touch, move through and shelter within. If it's good it should also inspire and uplift. Successful design reflects this reality, and is the stronger for it.",David Money Architects,http://www.davidmoney.com/,https://www.houzz.com/hznb/professionals/architects-and-building-designers/david-money-architects-pfvwgb-pf~1293819825,,,7 Reviews,Average rating: 5 out of 5 stars,+44 20 7587 3584,+44 20 7587 3584,https://st.hzcdn.com/fimgs/a983d69e09567f95_5145-w181-h181-b0-p0--.jpg,"3D Rendering, Architectural Design, Architectural Drawings, Basement Conversion, Basement Design, Bathroom Design, Building Design, Floor Plans, Home Renovation, House Extensions, House Plans, Kitchen Design, Kitchen Renovation, New Home Construction, Project Management, Space Planning"

Our principal focus is with existing residential accommodation, and through close analysis of our own domestic requirements, together with those of our peers and clients, aim to improve existing domestic landscapes. We aim to empower our clients through careful design based on spatial, programmatic, economic, environmental and social considerations. We aim to protect and enhance the character inherent in so many of the buildings with which we work, whilst also creating new spaces that anticipate and support new programmes and relationships within. We also promote and coordinate performance upgrades to the associated building fabric and services, in order that we can meet wider social and environmental demands. 

Whilst every job is unique, we also understand the inherent advantages of standardisation and have formulated a number of design approaches and specifications that are directly transferable from one project to the next. This level of standardisation enables us to offer high quality design to a broader client base as it helps maintain economic efficiency in terms of both fees and construction costs.

In parallel to providing architectural services, ARCHEA also develop private projects. We find this to be an incredible opportunity to test our ideas together with new techniques and materials. At the same time we aim to set precedent for the economic viability of small scale architectural interventions where otherwise they may be conceived as uneconomically viable.

At the heart of what we do is reinvigorate spaces that have become unusable or outdated for modern day life. We work closely with our residential clients in London to breathe life into buildings and to adapt each home to client's way of life, their design tastes and budget.

With skilful refurbishment and extensions, we are able to regenerate an existing dated building into a welcoming, functional and contemporary setting, with an emphasis on being environmentally sound. We always seek to maximise the potential and bring out the beauty of a space. 

We like re-claimed materials, adopted, adapted and boldly fused with the best of modern design; a mixture of light Industrial components and materials, with their confident aesthetics and precision, juxtaposed with the more modest, rudimentary, craft-like aesthetics of natural materials and on-site techniques. 

We treat colour with a similar logic by exposing and enhancing it. Applied colour is introduced to add dynamism and underline the difference between the building's permanent structure verses its fit-out.

We work as a team with other consultants and contractors to create innovative, realistic and exceptional quality designs. Always keeping in mind that we work for, and with, the client.

I firmly believe that we can all benefit from good design - it shouldn’t just be available for the 1%. 

After being a partner in city law firm for many years, I re-trained as an interior designer at the Chelsea College of Art. I'm an associate member of the British Institute of Interior Designers and run my own small design practice and take on work all over London. 

I definitely have my own style (you can see my house here on my profile). But I’m just not the sort of designer (or person, frankly) to impose their own look on clients. I’d much rather design a scheme in collaboration with clients and and other professionals. It’s not my home - it’s yours. But what I can bring is my experience and expertise to make the best of your space. My client-centric approach doesn’t mean I don’t take inspiration from the design community or follow trends. We don’t tend to wear the same clothes or listen to the same music our parents do (or even we did ourselves 10 years ago) so there is no reason our homes should be stuck in the same time warp! Small tweaks can make a big difference both to your home and to your mindset.

I love doing full house refurbishments as I can really get stuck in, get to know you and help you avoid the decision fatigue. Creating a home can be a very rewarding process and I’d love to be on that journey with you. But I’m also happy to take on smaller projects - a kitchen extension, bathroom refurbishments, colour schemes.

PROJECTS
We have a lot of experience in working on sites with complex and particular constraints. A lot of the work we have undertaken has been modification and retrofitting of existing buildings. Rear Extensions; Basement extensions; Loft extensions; internal reconfigurations. It can be an extremely rewarding experience to see through the transformation of an existing building and unlock new possibilities within it. There are particular stages within a project when things are stripped back and alternative spaces can be seen beyond what is existing at the time. It is the job of your architect to reveal these possibilities to you in advance within a process that allows you to make good decisions and get the most out of what for most people is a once in a lifetime project. 

PROCESS
All projects are developed through a collaborative process. At the outset it is about developing the brief through conversation >> a back and forth of design concepts and critique in relation to functional and design aspirations, as well as understanding site context and regulatory environment. This is followed by design development through drawing, modelling and visualisation. We can handle submission of plans to the council for planning approval. On approvals technical design and production information is undertaken for the purpose of pricing, building control and tendering the building contract. Once on site we can undertake contract administration to ensure that works are carried out in accordance with the designs and satisfy building regulations. At all stages you the client are invited into the process to comment, steer and ultimately sign off proposals. Every stage is important in its own way, from setting the direction and parameters at the start, exploring the options and pushing the possibilities in the middle, to ensuring things are resolved and executed in the later stages.

Ultimately we have an interest in developing robust, well considered, environmentally conscious and beautiful buildings which leave our clients satisfied and happy in their new environment.

We like working very closely with our clients, understanding their style and needs and respond with something extra for them that they don’t expect.

We hold fast to the tenets of classical modernism and Bauhaus design principles. In our view, good design should be timeless and enduring, and should not be influenced by fads and fashions. We believe in the mantra that ‘form follows function’, and that the value of any architectural design is enhanced by its utility. Over the years we have developed a brand of ‘user-friendly minimalism’. We promote the concept of creative living by delivering innovative, dynamic architectural spaces, which are easy to live in and inspirational at the same time.

Céline really understands customer service, and was extremely helpful in choosing the Italian marble effect porcelain tiles, showing us a computer generated image of the finished bathroom. We were most impressed by all the advice, the way the entire project was handled, with excellent communication - swift and comprehensive responses to queries even when Céline was out of the office abroad. Céline also sourced the superb custom made granite shelf to cover the cistern top. Thoroughly recommended.,Like,January 9, 2019,P Bhatia,Relationship,Client,Project Date,Oct 2018,Project Price,$1,000 - $9,999,Sometimes things go wrong with the best of suppliers.  What matters is how they deal with it.  We had something go wrong with our project.  Kaiser and his team responded amazingly with a creative solution that we were very happy with.  Well done to the team who delivered a high quality project for us!

Would definitely work with them again.,Like,October 26, 2018,Fauzia Khan,Relationship,Client,Project Date,Jun 2017,Project Price,more than $100,000,The Style team was amazing.  We refurbished our whole house and Kaiser, John, Charlotte, Maggie and Mahir worked together with the builder to ensure the tiles, bathroom furniture and fittings arrived on time.  They were extremely patient when we were choosing the tiles, flooring and carpets and put up with us changing our minds.  They were also really helpful with choosing the tiling.  We used their interior design and project management service over the architect and were delighted with the result,Like,October 6, 2018,Florence Trepizur,Relationship,Client,Project Date,Jun 2018,Project Price,$1,000 - $9,999,I recently worked with Karolina Gonciaz at Style Ideas Ltd. I did a major house extension and needed to create 2 bathrooms. I had an idea of the colour  scheme I wanted and had seen many tile shops already.  As soon as I entered the shop, I was impressed. Not only the choice and quality of their products / tiles is superb, Karolina's advice and interior design ideas were amazing and very much in line with what I , in fact, was looking for: she listened and understood exactly what I would like. She is friendly, lovely to work with, attentive, knowledgeable and very professional. In addition, the service, follow up, delivery were excellent. I am very proud of the 2 bathrooms I now have and this is thanks to Style Ideas and Karolina. I am highly recommending Style Ideas for their professional approach, interior design experience and knowledge, quality of products and meeting deadline and budget.,Like,August 31, 2018,Valentin Nedelea,Relationship,I have consulted and bought materials from this company for three bathrooms,Project Date,Mar 2018,Project Price,$1,000 - $9,999,we were pleasantly surprised to be able to have such a good connection with all the people working for this company. They have provided us with sensible and well thought of ideas and suggestions whilst the quality of the products bought through/from them were spot on. We will have no hesitation whatsoever to recommend them and also to use their expertise in the future.
Valentin Nedelea
Additional information:
In three separate occasions within almost one year we have planned with them the interior design of all three bathrooms that we have redone after almost 20 years and we have found their input, after them  taking on board our own requirements, as being a very professional and esthetic orientated one and we went for most of their ideas. We have to say that the end result was as per our initial expectations. It has never been a matter of pricing as they never pushed us and left us choose what we thought it will work and for us that was a very reassuring thing. Nice people to do business with.

I would highly recommend Style Ideas Ltd and i would use them again like a shot.  I felt I got a personalised service and was really happy with all my dealings with them.  The job I employed them for was retiling my bathroom,Like,August 23, 2018,Last modified:,August 24, 2018,Hafsa EI,Relationship,Client,Project Date,Apr 2018,Project Price,$50,000 - $100,000,I cannot recommend Style Ideas enough...I’m incredibly particular, very specific about my requirements and project specifications...I worked closely with Karolina and Mahir who are absolutely wonderful and have a wealth of knowledge on varying items. They understood exactly what I wanted....not forgetting Kaiser who not only runs the company but personally oversaw our project and ensured we were always happy with the service and how the project was being delivered. 

We had a large project of varying items which included 5 complete bathrooms, tiles, fittings, flooring for inside and outside the home, carpeting and wall coverings for the entire home. Style Ideas were able to find options with my specific remit, even if it meant they’d have to source new items for me. They were always at hand to help (outside of working hours too) and advise, they always took a lot of care of all our project requirements and were incredibly helpful on items outside their remit too!!!

I cannot recommend them enough!,Like,August 23, 2018,Last modified:,August 23, 2018,HU-860148810,Relationship,Bought materials and bathroom furniture from them,Project Date,May 2018,Project Price,$10,000 - $49,999,We bought bathroom tiles, furniture and wooden flooring from The Style Ideas and we are really impressed with customer services they offered. Everybody is friendly, efficient and knowledgable.  Celine has been extremely helpful to us throughout the project. She patiently guided us to choose the right products out of the fantastic range on offer, she provided samples and specifications and regularly kept us informed of the progress of our orders. Her friendly and relaxed but professional approach brought a real enjoyment to our otherwise stressful project. I think we have found a one-stop shop for all our future redecorating  needs. Highly recommended.,Like,June 19, 2018,HU-58349314716,Relationship,Client,Project Date,Jun 2017,Project Price,$10,000 - $49,999,If you want to experience 5 star customer service then Style is the company of choice. We started on our journey as complete amateurs and from the moment we walked into the showroom we were made to feel comfortable and in good hands. Kaiser and his team guided and advised us from the outset of our journey and by the end we felt like experts due to their sound advice and support. The team could not do enough for us, not only with the products we directly purchased from them but with every other aspect of our build. I cannot recommend Kaiser and team highly enough, and have never experienced such high quality customer service! We have now reached the end of our build and have not only acquired a new home but also a great friendship in Kaiser and team. Many thanks to you all!,Like,June 17, 2018,Mosh Aboobaker,Relationship,Client,Project Date,Jul 2018,Project Price,$10,000 - $49,999,Few, independent boutique, family run businesses can afford to offer exceptional customer service; that is, however, exactly what you should from Style Ideas. From blue printing plans and ideas, mood boarding shortlists and besoke and thoughtful suggestions, the entire team from Kaiser, through to Karolina and John make every effort to ensure you are happy, content and ultimately in control of the design.

I couldn't recommend Style Ideas enough for all of your design needs.,Like,June 14, 2018,N Love,Relationship,Client,Project Date,Jan 2018,Project Price,$1,000 - $9,999,We hired them during a big build project to source our wood effect floor tiles for the extension and the outside patio to create an 'inside out' feel, they also sourced some huge unique Spanish tiles for a splashback in the kitchen, our downstairs utility cloakroom and our new bathroom suite. The quality was excellent and a couple of problems with tile delivery we had were sorted immediately. In fact the owner arranged for a faulty tile to be picked up and replaced same day! They are all about finding solutions not problems, gave us good advice and were able to store things until we needed them. Jean did a great job on helping us throughout our project. I don't hesitate to recommend them.,Like,June 1, 2018,Last modified:,June 1, 2018,michelle_knaggs,Relationship,Client,Project Date,Nov 2016,Project Price,$50,000 - $100,000,Maggie has been exceptionally helpful.  She has supported us with everything from design to specifications to finding the right products to suit our needs.  She has even gone out of her way to try to source products that weren't already supplied to Style Ideas.  Her help has extended from the flooring throughout our property, to our entire bathroom suite, to our kitchen design.

We work by having an initial consultation, whether in person or video conference to determine the first thoughts on the style, colour palette, dimensions as well as the scope of work required and functional use of the space. 

Our team will then develop a few different designs based on this initial consultation which is presented to the client for approval to get a clear vision of the design and style direction.

At Law Unto Ren we are client lead which means we can cater to all tastes and styles whether you're looking for the clean lines of Minimalism or Mid-Century Modernism through to the decadence of Rococo or Victorian luxury. Or even a blend of styles! We have a design to suit you, that puts you in the centre of the design growth.

We love the feeling clients have when they can seamlessly move around their home or business with the knowledge that the space is being used to its full potential and functionality. When there's a place for everything and everything is in its place. 

We love creating spaces where clients feel at home,  whether it be commercial or residential, that their property reflects the taste, style, mood and above all the functionality they envisioned for their home or business. Spaces that are luxurious aesthetically without comprising  on required use of the space and delivered within budget.

Law Unto Ren, Ren Campbell Ltd was founded with the aim to make its customers feel at home in the spaces they work and live by creating an atmosphere that lends itself to the complex nature of the client's needs and tastes. Using aesthetic illusions to make small areas feel bigger and airier through innovative use of surfaces to refract light into dark coves or bringing structure to large open plan spaces with innovative design married with utilitarian design concepts.

Law Unto Ren is a client lead design company who puts the clients vision at the heart of what we do. We genuine care about the client's experience throughout and on completion of the design.

Beauty and functionality underpin our work, providing the framework upon which to carefully layer colour, pattern, texture and a curated mix of old and new for a unique & playful spirit.

With a focus on natural materials, authenticity, and craftsmanship we seek to deliver warm, intimate spaces that cultivate a sense of solace and restoration. We are inspired by the natural world, and aim to enhance this connection in every interior, not only in the selection of materials, but with a focus on maximising light & space wherever possible. Utilising a considered & collaborative approach, we develop and communicate the narrative of the client and blend it with cues from the surrounding landscape, culture, and architectural vernacular to create timeless, honest designs.

We are not trend seekers, nor do we own a ‘house style’, but prefer to start each project fresh, with the client brief defining the overall direction. That said, we do not take ourselves too seriously, and enjoy adding a dash of whimsy and surprise where and when we can. Characterised by creative & bespoke solutions, we believe design should reflect how you live and thus, your home should work hard for you. The end result is interior spaces that inspire and delight.

It is said to take around 10,000 hours to get really good at something. So at 20,000 hours and counting perhaps we can afford ourselves a little confidence.

We’ve been quietly making and perfecting our class-leading timber box sash window since 1995. Now with a new factory in SW London and investment from some existing happy clients we’ve pulled all the strings together under the newly created banner 'Goodwood Fitch' – a newly formed company with a tried and tested product.

We’re confident in saying there is ‘probably’ no better timber sash window manufactured in Britain today. Whilst others rely on good photography and high pressure salesmen to bamboozle end users we rely on:

Beautiful detailing, quality materials and real joinery to ensure that our windows are specified time and time again by architects, project managers and high end developers who really know what’s good and what’s not.

The quality and look of the windows can make or break a project. A Goodwood Fitch window not only looks perfect it’s built to last and to exacting standards.

When a new client opens and closes one of our windows for the first time the reaction is always similar – a smile, a nod and a look that says – you were right these are a bit special!

Innovative design has been at the heart of XAMI since inception. Founder, Bernard Zammit, grew up in Glasgow against a backdrop of world-famous Rennie Mackintosh buildings.

Today, Bernard Zammit is driven by the problem-solving element of design - and not only finding solutions, but beautiful solutions. XAMI has wide-ranging and extensive experience & are particularly passionate about bespoke requirements and aesthetics.

Your Flooring Guide:

Engineered floors - these are made of layers of different types of wood. They are extremely stable and can be installed either onto a flat existing floor or floating over an underlay. Engineered floors are ideal for underfloor heating.

Pre-finished floors - these are either varnished or oiled and ready to be installed. They do not require any other treatment, which makes installation fairly quick.

Varnished floors - these are painted with a natural varnish that forms a thin film over the top layer. Oiled floors go through the same process but the oil absorbs into the grain of the wood. Varnished floors can come in many different colours while oiled floors are more restricted.

Finish - a floor’s finish is the mechanical machining of the surface. This can be sanded, brushed, scraped etc. Each different process gives the flooring a different appearance.",Italian Design Ltd,http://www.italiandesignltd.co.uk/,https://www.houzz.com/hznb/professionals/carpet-dealers/italian-design-ltd-pfvwgb-pf~505983960,"GBP 500 - GBP 25,000,Flooring from £25 per sqm and installation from £30 per sqm.

I was originally going to be an artist but always struggled with how self indulgent it was. After a year at Chelsea art college I realised that architecture was the ultimate art form - it's creative, yet responsible. There are so many parameters to work within and the art is in making it appear that there were no parameters at all. Where the emergence of a desire to marry the creativity of design with practical parameters led to an interest in the built environment. 

After completing formal training in architecture at Kingston University (BA Hons) and University of East London (Post Graduate Diploma) I went on to work with award winning, internationally renowned architectural practices, such as Allies+Morrison, Woods Bagot, HKS and JRA. 

His passion for residential architecture developed alongside a pursuit of quality, innovation and honesty in design, resulting in the creation of imby3.

I love the excitement of a new project, a blank canvas and the endless opportunities in front. I love the design development as the project starts to take shape, I love the problem solving. I love the in-depth design, where we flesh out the early ideas and work out details that will look great, and then the excitement of starting on site is great too.

We offer a very personal service. Amanda works behind the scenes so clients mostly work directly with me alone. I assist from the beginning all the way through to completion. 

We have hired assistants in the past to do our drawings for us, but I found the most successful projects were where the same person that had the client relationship also had a relationship with the house. Therefore I always survey the house at the start of the project too.

Our best projects are the ones where our clients open up and I get to know them. I can then second guess what they're thinking or what they'd want/need on a programmatic level or even when selecting finishes and fittings.

I firmly believe each new project should be better than the last.

""Innovation has been key when designing for small urban gardens. Space is at a premium therefore ingenuity is essential in forming multi use areas.  My design ethos has always been to create harmonious gardens which suit the space and budget. With the use of distinctive lighting and expert planting I love the challenge of transforming even the smallest of spaces.""

""Once I have gathered as much information form the client, I then produce initial drawings which can be perfected along the way. Once the design is established a final set of visuals and technical drawings are produced, this is supported by mood boards, a planting plan and a lighting plan. At this stage I can recommend one of my landscaping contractors I regularly work with or I am equally happy to collaborate with the clients chosen landscapers.""",Georgia Lindsay Garden Design,http://glgardendesign.houzz.co.uk,https://www.houzz.com/hznb/professionals/landscape-architects-and-landscape-designers/georgia-lindsay-garden-design-pfvwgb-pf~1511575146,"£20k - 80K,Projects tend to be between 20-80k for the build.

From exacting standards of design detail to rigorous quality control, every aspect of production is considered as ‘Art’. Though each floor we make is beautiful to the eye, it has a built-in practicality promise, that means it will stand the test of time in both commercial or residential areas. 

Our quality assurance means we only ever stock the very best certificated Oak and American Walnut, at our factory in Yorkshire, England. A large, on-site stock holding, means we can ensure a swift response to ever demanding deadlines, that what we’re all about.

Parquet is usually a tricky flooring option...
The concept for Cheville stemmed from a desire to take the tricky and turn it into something simple. 

And here's why..
1. Its engineered - Because they are engineered, all of our parquet blocks can be laid direct on top of an underlay, this is especially important for the homeowner wanting to reduce noise below if living in an apartment. They are also suitable over under floor heating.

2. Its Pre-finished - Usually parquet requires sanding and sealing after installation, our floors are expertly hand finished before they are despatched, so installation is similar to laying an engineered plank floor.

3. Its affordable - Usually parquet is way beyond most peoples budgets, but ours range from £57 to £86. With installation working out at around £20.

4. Its bespoke - All of our floors are expertly hand finished using Dutch Hardwax Oils. All of our stock is held unfinished at our factory in Yorkshire. We have over 70 stock shades, but can do bespoke finishes upon request. We can do distressing, wire brushing, band sawing and hand scraping.

5. Its planned out - We take a plan of the proposed floor space and work out how many blocks will be required for the project, meaning no under or over estimations. Clients can see how the floor will look in the living space before they have it. If a client wants a border, we plan it out on a CAD system and cut all the blocks to size.This way everything fits like a jigsaw puzzle when it arrives on-site, making installation simple and leaving little room for error.",Cheville Parquet,http://www.cheville.co.uk,https://www.houzz.com/hznb/professionals/carpet-dealers/cheville-parquet-pfvwgb-pf~1829059993,"£50+vat - £80+vat,We are a supply only company.

As a professional Interior Designer, for the past 7 years, I have successfully taken projects through from concept to completion. We believe that a home can be beautiful and functional; an ideal space to truly enjoy, entertain and relax in. Over the years, we’ve worked with scores of clients to elevate their interiors and inspiring them to modify their styles and add certain chic elements that take their interiors from mediocre to wonderful.

Of course, we do this with their unique needs and lifestyle in mind so every aspect of my services will be tailored to individual requirements. As someone who is creative, technically minded and has great attention to detail. We can easily create, develop, and produce unique high-end results and premium style. From minor projects like delivering a glass splashback to completing an entire home renovation, a creative challenge is right up my alley.

We are used to working in a fast paced environment with demanding deadlines, and therefore we can quickly create superb individual conceptual requirements, work out costs and prepare budget estimates. We also possess excellent communication and presentational skills and will be very comfortable liaising directly with clients at all levels. We do what it takes to complete projects on time and work around your schedule.

For clients looking for a complete one-to-one bespoke service but hesitant about the costs involved, we can create personalised packages that are practical and affordable.

EUROPEAN PROPERTY AWARDS 2017",https://st.hzcdn.com/simgs/f262c0790b50b3f6_17-9808/home-design.jpg,Interior Designers and Decorators,London UK ,"O&A Design is a London branch of the highly regarded and award-winning Russian company Oleg Klodt Architecture & Design that was founded in 2000.

Every project we undertake is carried by a professional team — where every single person has extensive experience in architecture and design. The studio is divided into five departments — design, architecture, 3D visualisations, procurement and PR. Our portfolio includes scores of projects we have completed for private apartments and homes — alongside interiors we had designed for hotels, restaurants, and stores.

We re-examine the space conceptually, by opening up its individuality and filling it with life which is comfortable and dynamic. Eclecticity of our designs breaks down the walls allowing them to think outside the box, beyond the realm of a specific style, and favours experimenting.

The creative tandem of Oleg Klodt and Anna Agapova has been catalytic in establishing and developing the studio’s work. While Oleg Klodt works with brevity and clarity in a traditional style, Anna Agapova stays ahead of trends in the way she completes interiors — bringing multiple eclecticisms to a classical format, with new textures and shapes. A unique character of their creations lies in the harmonious interaction of large and small shapes, in space and light union, in distinctive plasticity of rooms as well as organic coexistence of objects, moulding their style and appearance.

We are the members of the Society of British and International Design (SBID), one of the most prestigious European organisation that establishes European standards in interior design, accredits professionals from around the world and helps to more effectively interact with designers, producers in their home country and abroad.

For many years the studio has been included in the top 100 best design studios of the world according to Andrew Martin — The Oscars of the Interior Design world.

Studio’s projects regularly appear on the pages of world top media such as Elle Decoration, Architectural Digest, Wallpaper, Object, Marie Claire, Attitude, Bridge for Design and others.",O&A Design,https://www.oa-design.com,https://www.houzz.com/hznb/professionals/interior-designers-and-decorators/oanda-design-pfvwgb-pf~154148035,"GBP 100,000 - GBP 3,500,000",,7 Reviews,Average rating: 5 out of 5 stars,+44 20 3981 4788,+44 20 3981 4788,https://st.hzcdn.com/fimgs/1b5391d10b460f48_9860-w181-h181-b0-p0--.jpg,"3D Rendering, Home Cinema Design, Interior Design, Interior Styling, Space Planning, Home Renovation"

Ocean Bathrooms was founded in 1993 by Robert and Sharon Mühl.

Robert had spent a number of years working in the bathroom industry, repping for a shower and shower door manufacturer, a tile retailer and generally coming to the conclusion that although there was an awful lot of bathroom products in the market place, there did not appear to be any where the general public could see anything working or indeed try any of said products out. “it all seemed very confused, with no one person actually putting the customers ideas and needs first.”  - So he set out to put that right.

The showroom in Bridport is painstakingly thought out with the comfort of the customer taking priority.

Working baths with different fillers, powerful rain dance showers, heated radiators, and heated floors all vie for attention in this fully working showroom.

All the designer brands are on show and with plenty of ideas from the “passionate about bathrooms” designer team. Ocean Bathrooms is really a great destination showroom.

Robert and Sharon want all their customers to enjoy planning and choosing their bathroom.

The ethos is to listen  to the customer and to treat every bathroom design as a new beginning of a working relationship culminating in the perfect bathroom.

Customers of Ocean Bathrooms have recognised the benefits that such experience provides in bringing them the best solutions for bathroom design. Luxury and Designer Bathrooms and accessories are sourced from the world's best suppliers to bring you outstanding designs offering both quality and value together with innovative solutions.

But you don't have to take our word for it. When you visit one of our showrooms why not try out the steam temples, showers and spa baths yourself?

Most of our roomsets incorporate working models so you can experience the quality first-hand and know you have made the best choice.

By having an integrated design team, the client does not have to contact multiple designers every time the design requirements change or additional surveys are required.

Our passion is designing spaces so that they not only look great but work and flow effortlessly. A dream kitchen, for example, needs to work for your love of cooking and hosting supper clubs! We’ll approach the design of your home in the same way that we have approached our own homes. It turns the traditional process on its head: we want to start with the way you want your home to look, feel and work. From there, we can work back through the interior design and space planning requirements, structural engineering, and external architecture. 

We have a network of contractors that we regularly work with, and we’re happy to make recommendations and introductions as you need for the construction phase of your project.

The practice has a well established experience in a wide range of sectors and scales, both in the United Kingdom and abroad, from small extensions to substantial interior refurbishment and re-modelling, including retail and furniture design. 

Whether one project is an opportunity to celebrate the ordinary or, vice versa, the extraordinary, is the consistent approach in resolving our clients‘ ambitions and the complexity or simplicity of their brief - regardless of size and budget -, that has become the starting point of an ongoing research into the rituals of the inhabitation of domestic and urban spaces.

A sense of movement, rotation and dynamism is often found in most of our projects, being they public, commercial, residential, follies or temporary structures and installations. We strongly believe that a space with dynamic qualities can enhance people‘s spirit and contribute to engage with the space that they use. We obtain this by a clever and careful arrangement of the spaces, by activating the senses, or via a physical interaction with the elements that inform each and every one of our projects.

We are Studio Vie.
We create beautiful and functionally practical spaces.  
From a single room refresh to a full-scale build, renovation or refurbishment.
Whatever your style.  Whatever your budget.

Our clients generally have one thing in common: the desire to create a beautiful and functional space in an enjoyable and stress-free way.  We are passionate about helping them to achieve that and never tire of the buzz we get from the transformation of the ordinary to the stunning, always ensuring that it is truly reflective of each client's personality and taste.  

Whether you are seeking a simple cosy sanctuary, some Mad Men-esque mid-century modern, the cool vibe of a rough-luxe industrial space, some glamorous Hollywood Regency opulence, a wacky colour-filled party pad, a minimalist retreat, or something completely different, we will work with you to realise your space.

Or you may simply have no idea what you want, or even what you really like. Together we can work that out, and then we can work with you to create it.

With a busy family home and three children, our lead designer, Rebecca, appreciates how essential it is to consider beyond the aesthetic to create a space that is functional, practical and a pleasure to use.  Rebecca understands that you probably have other demands on your time. Interior works are time consuming – endless searching for the perfect look, ordering items, finding tradespersons, dealing with problems and making sure that it all takes shape in the way that you want.  We will work with you to take away the hassle and to bring the fun and excitement back into the project.  You can be involved as much or as little as you like.

We are flexible about how we work and tailor make a menu of services for each client, giving them the option to pick and choose which of our offerings they feel will best suit their needs and budget.  

We'd love to chat about creating the perfect space for you.  Our initial consultation is free of charge and without obligation.  No project is too large, too small or too tricky.

MOOD BOARDS
Once the overall layout is agreed, the focus moves onto design and specification of fabrics, wallcoverings, paints and floor coverings.  Samples of each are presented along with proposed furniture, lighting and accessory ideas.  Each board helps the client to visualize the finished design.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT
Projects can be either fully managed or if the client prefers to self-manage then the design can be handed over to the contractors with close liaison to ensure the smooth delivery of the finished article.

We have a strong network of suppliers, builders, architects, landscape designers, bespoke kitchen and furniture suppliers, and bathroom specialists.  Work is closely monitored on and off-site to ensure each specialist carries out work to the highest standard.  All members of the team work closely together to ensure seamless work is carried out.
